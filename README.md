# Recipe-CRUD-Spring-Boot
A CRUD for recipes, in Spring Boot. The users have different privileges and can create public or private recipes,
these effects are reflected with how they can interact with the page. Spring Security and Hibernate were moderately 
used. log4j was enabled, jQuery was used for AJAX and DOM access.
